abstract = {Continuous online monitoring of rotating machines is necessary to assess real-time health conditions so as to enable early detection of operation problems and thus reduce the possibility of downtime. Rolling element bearings are crucial parts of many machines and there has been an increasing demand to find effective and reliable health monitoring technique and advanced signal processing to detect and diagnose the size and location of incipient defects. Condition monitoring of rolling element bearings, comprises four main stages which are, statistical analysis, fault diagnostics, defect size calculation, and prognostics. In this paper the effect of defect size, operating speed, and loading conditions on statistical parameters of acoustic emission (AE) signals, using design of experiment method (DOE), have been investigated to select the most sensitive parameters for diagnosing incipient faults and defect growth on rolling element bearings. A modified and effective signal processing algorithm is designed to diagnose localized defects on rolling element bearings components under different operating speeds, loadings, and defect sizes. The algorithm is based on optimizing the ratio of Kurtosis and Shannon entropy to obtain the optimal band pass filter utilizing wavelet packet transform (WPT) and envelope detection. Results show the superiority of the developed algorithm and its effectiveness in extracting bearing characteristic frequencies from the raw acoustic emission signals masked by background noise under different operating conditions. To experimentally measure the defect size on rolling element bearings using acoustic emission technique, the proposed method along with spectrum of squared Hilbert transform are performed under different rotating speeds, loading conditions, and defect sizes to measure the time difference between the double AE impulses. Measurement results show the power of the proposed method for experimentally measuring size of different fault shapes using acoustic emission signals.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new analytical model for the influence of rolling-element bearing faults on induction motor stator current. Bearing problems are one major cause for drive failures. Their detection is possible by vibration monitoring of characteristic bearing frequencies. As it is possible to detect other machine faults by monitoring the stator current, a great interest exists in applying the same method for bearing fault detection. After a presentation of the existing fault model, a new detailed approach is proposed. It is based on the following two effects of a bearing fault: 1) the introduction of a particular radial rotor movement and 2) load torque variations caused by the bearing fault. The theoretical study results in new expressions for the stator current frequency content. Experimental tests with artificial and realistic bearing damage were conducted by measuring vibration, torque, and stator current. The obtained results by spectral analysis of the measured quantities validate the proposed theoretical approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Vibration failure is a common problem in most rotating machinery, and vibration fault diagnosis is an important means of ensuring stable equipment operation. The present work proposes a rotor vibration fault diagnosis approach that transforms multiple vibration signals into symmetrized dot pattern (SDP) images, and then identifies the SDP graphical feature characteristic of different vibration states using a convolutional neural network (CNN). SDP images reveal different vibration states in a simple and intuitive manner. In addition, a CNN can reliably and accurately identify vibration faults by extracting the feature information of SDP images adaptively through deep learning. The proposed approach is tested experimentally using a rotor vibration test bed, and the results obtained are compared to those obtained with an equivalent CNN-based image recognition approach using orbit plot images. The rotor fault diagnosis precision is improved from 92% to 96.5%.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach on motor current signature analysis (MCSA) for broken bar fault detection of induction motors (IMs), using as input the current signal measured from one of the three motor phases. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used over the Fourier-domain spectral signals obtained from the input and its autocorrelation function. The standard deviation of spectral components within a region of interest (ROI) of an ICA signal output was found to exhibit substantial differences between damaged and healthy motors. Separation of the ROI in one, two, and three sectors leads to an improved extraction of feature vectors, which are further fed into a neural network for classification purposes. The assessment of the proposed method is carried out through several experiments using two damage levels (broken bar and half broken bar) and two load motor conditions (50% and 75%), with a classification accuracy ranging from 90% to 99%. The contribution of this paper lies in a new technique of signal processing for ICA-based feature extraction in a 3-D feature space for IM fault diagnosis.},

abstract = {The reliability of power electronics systems is of paramount importance in industrial, commercial, aerospace, and military applications. The knowledge about fault mode behavior of an induction motor drive system is extremely important from the standpoint of improved system design, protection, and fault-tolerant control. This paper addresses the application of motor current spectral analysis for the detection and localization of abnormal electrical and mechanical conditions that indicate, or may lead to, a failure of induction motors. Intensive research effort has been for some time focused on the motor current signature analysis. This technique utilizes the results of spectral analysis of the stator current. Reliable interpretation of the spectra is difficult since distortions of the current waveform caused by the abnormalities in the induction motor are usually minute. This paper takes the initial step to investigate the efficiency of current monitoring for diagnostic purposes. The effects of stator current spectrum are described and the related frequencies determined. In the present investigation, the frequency signature of some asymmetrical motor faults are well identified using advanced signal processing techniques, such as high-resolution spectral analysis. This technique leads to a better interpretation of the motor current spectra. In fact, experimental results clearly illustrate that stator current high-resolution spectral analysis is very sensitive to induction motor faults modifying main spectral components, such as voltage unbalance and single-phasing effects.},

abstract = {Model based methods for fault identification in rotating systems are gaining importance for the last three decades due to their ability to identify both location and severity of the fault. Model based methods are of different types. Among them, equivalent loads minimization method is one method. In this method, fault is identified in a rotor bearing system by minimizing difference between equivalent loads estimated in the system due to the fault and theoretical fault model loads. This method has a limitation that the error in identified fault parameters increases with decrease in number of measured vibrations. Thus a comprehensive methodology for fault identification with minimum error even in case of fewer measured vibrations is attempted in the present work. Two different approaches: equivalent loads minimization and vibration minimization method are applied for the identification of unbalance fault in a rotor system. Unbalance fault is identified using proposed methods by measuring transverse vibrations at only one location. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an intelligent method based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to detect bearing defects of induction motors. In this method, the vibration signal passes through removing non-bearing fault component (RNFC) filter, designed by neural networks, in order to remove its non-bearing fault components, and then enters the second neural network that uses pattern recognition techniques for fault classification. Four different categories include; healthy, inner race defect, outer race defect, and double holes in outer race are investigated. Compared to the regular fault detection methods that use frequency-domain features, the proposed method is based on analyzing time-domain features which needs less computational effort. Moreover, machine and bearing parameters, and the vibration signal spectrum distribution are not required in this method. It is shown that better results are achieved when the filtered component of the vibration signal is used for fault classification rather than common methods that use directly vibration signal. Experimental results on three-phase induction motor verify the ability of the proposed method in fault diagnosis despite low quality (noisy) of measured vibration signal. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Monitor transformer operating status by comparing the energy ratio of different frequency bands of the vibration signal. A vibration signal acquisition platform based on acceleration sensor is built in the monitoring system. The signal is collected for the vibration acceleration signal generated under different working conditions of the transformer. The cumulative probability distribution histogram and standard deviation of the acceleration signal are drawn. The acceleration signal is found to be random and its standard deviation will vary with the working state of the transformer. Therefore, the signal standard deviation can be compared with the normal operation of the transformer. If the phase difference is found to be large, it can be initially judged that the transformer operating state is abnormal. Then further analysis of the energy ratio of the different frequency bands to the total energy ratio can determine whether the transformer core and winding are faulty.

In the performance of all motor systems, bearings play an important role. Many problems arising in motor operations are linked to bearing faults. In many cases, the accuracy of the instruments and devices used to monitor and control the motor system is highly dependent on the dynamic performance of the motor bearings. Thus, fault diagnosis of a motor system is inseparably related to the diagnosis of the bearing assembly. In this paper, bearing vibration frequency features are discussed for motor bearing fault diagnosis. This paper then presents an approach for motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis using neural networks and time/frequency-domain bearing vibration analysis. Vibration simulation is used to assist in the design of various motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis strategies. Both simulation and real-world testing results obtained indicate that neural networks can be effective agents in the diagnosis of various motor bearing faults through the measurement and interpretation of motor bearing vibration signatures.},

To identify the operation status of the bearing an accurate relationship between the impulse response and the size and shape of the local defect is necessary. In this paper, a dynamic simulation method is proposed to study ball bearing with local defect based on the coupling of the piecewise function and the Hertzian contact mechanism at the edge of the local defect. The ball bearing is modeled as a two-degree of freedom system. The impulse force is determined by the ratio of the ball size to the defect size and the contact deformation at the edge of the local defect is included. The contact mechanical characteristics between the ball and the race with different defect sizes are studied and compared with available results in the literature. It is shown that the proposed method can provide a more close to real impulse for the contact between the ball and the race with different defect sizes compared to the assumed rectangular or half-sine impulse function. It is also shown that the proposed method provides a new method for dynamic simulation of ball with a localized defect. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, the independent component analysis (ICA) scheme was utilized to analyze vibration signals captured from a CS29 Category 'A' helicopter main gearbox, where bearing faults were seeded on the second epicyclic stage planetary gears bearing. The ICA scheme could separate the multichannel signals into the mutually independent components. The bearing defect signature can be clearly observed in one of the independent components. The analysis result showed that ICA scheme is a promising method for detecting the bearing fault signatures.},

abstract = {The amplitude and time duration of the impulse generated by a ball bearing passing over a local defect on the race are determined by the shape and size of the local defect. To identify the operation status of the bearing an accurate relationship between the impulse response and the size and shape of the local defect is necessary. In this paper, a dynamic simulation method is proposed to study ball bearing with local defect based on the coupling of the piecewise function and the Hertzian contact mechanism at the edge of the local defect. The ball bearing is modeled as a two-degree of freedom system. The impulse force is determined by the ratio of the ball size to the defect size and the contact deformation at the edge of the local defect is included. The contact mechanical characteristics between the ball and the race with different defect sizes are studied and compared with available results in the literature. It is shown that the proposed method can provide a more close to real impulse for the contact between the ball and the race with different defect sizes compared to the assumed rectangular or half-sine impulse function. It is also shown that the proposed method provides a new method for dynamic simulation of ball with a localized defect. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the application of an image recognition technique for the detection and diagnosis of ball bearing faults in rotating electrical machines (REMs). The conventional bearing fault detection and diagnosis (BFDD) methods rely on extracting different features from either waveforms or spectra of vibration signals to detect and diagnose bearing faults. In this paper, a novel vibration-based BFDD via a probability plot (ProbPlot) image recognition technique under constant and variable speed conditions is proposed. The proposed technique is based on the absolute value principal component analysis (AVPCA), namely, ProbPlot via image recognition using the AVPCA (ProbPlot via IR-AVPCA) technique. A comparison of the features (images) obtained: (1) directly in the time domain from the original raw data of the vibration signals; (2) by capturing the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) of the vibration signals; or (3) by generating the probability plot (ProbPlot) of the vibration signals as proposed in this paper, is considered. A set of realistic bearing faults (i.e., outer-race fault, inner-race fault, and balls fault) are experimentally considered to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed ProbPlot via the IR-AVPCA method.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the application of motor current spectral analysis for the detection of rolling-element bearing damage in induction machines. Vibration monitoring of mechanical bearing frequencies is currently wed to detect the presence of a fault condition. Since these mechanical vibrations are associated with variations in the physical air gap of the machine, the air gap flux density is modulated and stator currents are generated at predictable frequencies related to the electrical supply and vibrational frequencies. This paper takes the initial step of investigating the efficacy of current monitoring for bearing fault detection by correlating the relationship between vibration and current frequencies caused by incipient bearing failures. The bearing failure modes are reviewed and the characteristic bearing frequencies associated with the physical construction of the bearings are defined. The effects on the stator current spectrum are described and the related frequencies determined. This is an important result in the formulation of a fault detection scheme that monitors the stator currents. Experimental results which show the vibration and current spectra of an induction machine with different bearing faults are used to verify the relationship between the vibrational and current frequencies. The test results clearly illustrate that the stator current signature can be used to identify the presence of a bearing fault.},

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

abstract = {Effective fault diagnosis of rotating machinery has always been an important issue in real industries. In the recent years, data-driven fault diagnosis methods such as neural networks have been receiving increasing attention due to their great merits of high diagnosis accuracy and easy implementation. However, it is mostly difficult to fully train a deep neural network since gradients in optimization may vanish or explode during back-propagation, which results in deterioration and noticeable variance in model performance. In fault diagnosis researches, larger data sequence of machinery vibration signal containing sufficient information is usually preferred and consequently, deep models with large capacity are generally adopted. In order to improve network training, a residual learning algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed architecture significantly improves the information flow throughout the network, which is well suited for processing machinery vibration signal with variable sequential length. Little prior expertise on fault diagnosis and signal processing is required, that facilitates industrial applications of the proposed method. Experiments on a popular rolling bearing dataset are implemented to validate the proposed method. The results of this study suggest that the proposed intelligent fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery offers a new and promising approach.},

This paper proposes a method that can reliably estimate both the rotor unbalance and misalignment from a single machine run-down. This identification assumes that the source of misalignment is at the couplings of the multi-rotor system, and that this will generate constant synchronous forces and moments at the couplings depending upon the extent of the off-set between the two rotors, irrespective of the machine rotating speed. A flexible foundation model is also estimated. The method is demonstrated using experimental data from a machine with two bearings and a flexible coupling to the motor. A sensitivity analysis has also been carried out for the proposed approach with perturbation errors in the rotor and bearing models, to confirm the robustness of the method. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Image representation of time-series introduces different feature types that are not available for 1D signals, and therefore TSC can be treated as texture image recognition task. CNN model also allows learning different levels of representations together with a classifier, jointly and automatically. Therefore, using RP and CNN in a unified framework is expected to boost the recognition rate of TSC.

abstract = {Continuous online monitoring of rotating machines is necessary to assess real-time health conditions so as to enable early detection of operation problems and thus reduce the possibility of downtime. Rolling element bearings are crucial parts of many machines and there has been an increasing demand to find effective and reliable health monitoring technique and advanced signal processing to detect and diagnose the size and location of incipient defects. Condition monitoring of rolling element bearings, comprises four main stages which are, statistical analysis, fault diagnostics, defect size calculation, and prognostics. In this paper the effect of defect size, operating speed, and loading conditions on statistical parameters of acoustic emission (AE) signals, using design of experiment method (DOE), have been investigated to select the most sensitive parameters for diagnosing incipient faults and defect growth on rolling element bearings. A modified and effective signal processing algorithm is designed to diagnose localized defects on rolling element bearings components under different operating speeds, loadings, and defect sizes. The algorithm is based on optimizing the ratio of Kurtosis and Shannon entropy to obtain the optimal band pass filter utilizing wavelet packet transform (WPT) and envelope detection. Results show the superiority of the developed algorithm and its effectiveness in extracting bearing characteristic frequencies from the raw acoustic emission signals masked by background noise under different operating conditions. To experimentally measure the defect size on rolling element bearings using acoustic emission technique, the proposed method along with spectrum of squared Hilbert transform are performed under different rotating speeds, loading conditions, and defect sizes to measure the time difference between the double AE impulses. Measurement results show the power of the proposed method for experimentally measuring size of different fault shapes using acoustic emission signals.},

@article{Sawalhi2011,
abstract = {Fatigue in rolling element bearings, resulting in spalling of the races and/or rolling elements, is the most common cause of bearing failure. The useful life of the bearing may extend considerably beyond the appearance of the first spall and a premature removal of the bearing from service can be very expensive, but on the other hand chances cannot be taken with safety of machines or personnel. Previous studies indicated that there might be two parts to the defect vibration signal of a spalled bearing, the first part being originating from the entry of the rolling element into the fault (de-stress) and the second part being due to the departure of the rolling element from the fault (re-stress). This is investigated in this paper using vibration signatures of seeded faults at different speeds. The acceleration signals resulting from the entry of the rolling element into the spall and exit from it were found to be of different natures. The entry into the fault can be described as a step response, with mainly low frequency content, while the impact excites a much broader frequency impulse response. The latter is the most noticeable and prominent event, especially when examining the high pass filtered response or the enveloped signal. In order to enable a clear separation of the two events, and produce an averaged estimate of the size of the fault, two approaches are proposed to enhance the entry event while keeping the impulse response. The first approach (joint treatment) utilizes pre-whitening to balance the low and high frequency energy, then octave band wavelet analysis to allow selection of the best band (or scale) to balance the two pulses with similar frequency content. In the second approach, a separate treatment is applied to the step and the impulse responses, so that they can be equally represented in the signal. Cepstrum analysis can be used to give an average estimate of the spacing between the entry and impact events, but the latter can also be assessed by an arithmetic estimation of the mean and standard deviation of the event separation for a number of realizations, in particular for the second approach. In order to determine the effects of various simulations and signal processing parameters on the estimated delay times, the entry and exit events were simulated as modified step and impulse responses with precisely known starting times. The simulation was also found useful in pointing to artefacts associated with the cepstrum calculation, which affect even the simulated signals, and have thus prompted modifications of the processing of real signals. The results presented for the two approaches give a reasonable approximation of the measured fault widths (double the spacing between the entry and impact events) under different speed conditions, but the method of separate treatment is somewhat better and is thus recommended. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

@article{Artigao2018,
abstract = {The goal of the present paper is to achieve the diagnosis of an in-service 1.5 MW wind turbine equipped with a doubly-fed induction generator through current signature and vibration analyses. Real data from operating machines have rarely been analysed in the scientific literature through current signature analysis supported by vibrations. The wind turbine under study was originally misdiagnosed by the operator, where a healthy component was replaced and the actual failure continued progressing. The chronological evolution of both the electrical current and vibration spectra is presented to conduct an in-depth tracking of the fault. The diagnosis is achieved through spectral analysis of the stator currents, where fault frequency components related to rotor mechanical unbalance are identified. This is confirmed by the vibration analysis, which provides insightful information on the health of the drive train. These results can be implemented in condition monitoring strategies, which is of great interest to optimise operation and maintenance costs of wind farms.},

@article{Leandro2012,
abstract = {During the last few years, natural fiber composites are replacing synthetic fiber composites for practical applications due to their advantages like low density, light weight, low cost, biodegradability and high specific mechanical properties. In this connection, the present investigation deals with the fabrication and mechanical properties of unidirectional banana/jute hybrid fiber reinforced composites and compares with the single natural fiber reinforced composites. The physical and mechanical properties of the natural fiber composites were obtained by testing the composite for density, tensile, flexural, inter-laminar shear, impact, and hardness properties. The composite specimens with different weight percentages of fibers were fabricated by using hand lay-up technique and testing were carried out as per ASTM standards. Incorporation of both the fibers into epoxy matrix resulted in an increase in mechanical properties up to 30 wt% of fiber loading. It is found that the hybrid composite give encouraging results when compared with the individual fiber composites. The morphologies of the composites are also studied by scanning electron microscope.},

Detection of both localized and distributed categories of defect has been considered. An explanation for the vibration and noise generation in bearings is given. Vibration measurement in both time and frequency domains along with signal processing techniques such as the high-frequency resonance technique have been covered. Other acoustic measurement techniques such as sound pressure, sound intensity and acoustic emission have been reviewed. Recent trends in research on the detection of defects in bearings, such as the wavelet transform method and automated data processing, have also been included.},
